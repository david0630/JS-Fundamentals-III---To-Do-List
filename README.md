This is a simple to do list

Enter your items within the text box next to the "Add" button to populate a list

Once you have your list set, all itmes should appear under the red header

To mark off tasks, clicking on them will "cross" them out and produce a check-mark next to your crossed item

To "hide" completed or non-completed tasks to empty your list, there will be an 'x' button the right very right your can click. It will highlight red when hovering over it
